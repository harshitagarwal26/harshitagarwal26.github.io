# **About Me**

Hey, there! I am **{{ site.author.name }}** <br>

I am currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, after completing my undergraduate studies at BITS Pilani. Over the years, I have cultivated a strong interest in computer science, particularly in areas where technology meets real-world impact. My academic foundation, coupled with diverse professional experiences, has allowed me to bridge theory with practice and explore how technology can be harnessed to create secure, efficient, and scalable systems.

My professional journey has given me the opportunity to work on projects spanning reliability, large-scale data systems, and intelligent automation. These experiences not only strengthened my technical expertise but also deepened my understanding of the challenges in building systems that are both robust and impactful. I strongly believe that technology must be designed with both innovation and responsibility in mind, ensuring that advancements lead to meaningful and secure outcomes.

Throughout my academic and professional path, I have taken on projects that pushed me to apply my knowledge of algorithms, data systems, and software design to solve practical problems. These opportunities reinforced my passion for creating impactful solutions and furthered my commitment to leveraging technology responsibly.

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy staying active and exploring new experiences. I love hiking, traveling, and discovering new cuisines—especially when shared with friends. I’m always eager to try something new! I also enjoy reading, listening to music, and watching movies. If you’d like to chat about technology, innovation, or just connect, I’d be happy to!
