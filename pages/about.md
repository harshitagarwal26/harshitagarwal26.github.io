# **About Me**

Hey, there! I am **{{ site.author.name }}** <br>

I am in my senior year at BITS Pilani, where I am pursuing a dual major in Physics and Computer Science. I'd be graduating in 2023. I'm currently a research intern in <a href = "https://yoshuabengio.org/">Yoshua Bengio</a>'s group at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/"> MILA </a> where I am working on this super exciting idea of <a href = "https://milayb.notion.site/GFlowNet-Tutorial-919dcf0a0f0c4e978916a2f509938b00#501449fd3de348e8b93769a523d1769d">Generative Flow Networks</a>! 
 <br>

My long-term goal is to develop AI methods that enable AI agents to have the ability to give rise to new concepts by thinking and explaining phenomena that they have not been exposed to. Broadly, I want to understand how people integrate perception and reasoning to understand the world around them, and then appl the same to deep learning models. 

I am also actively learning about causality in deep learning, continual learning, language grounding, reinforcement learning and fariness in AI. (Feels like I'm all over the place? Well I'm just trying to figure out what I like the most.). If you have a project idea you'd like to discuss, let's get in touch!

Internships at several organizations have helped me gain solid ground in implementing deep learning based models. I’ve successfully completed projects using object detection modules, super-resolution networks, graph neural networks, auto-encoders, autoregressive networks and transformers. I’m well-acquainted with machine learning algorithms like discriminant analysis, stochastic regression, and decision trees. 

Work apart, I love hiking and travelling! I really enjoy meeting people from different parts of the world, and learning about their culture. I’m an outgoing introvert. I am a huge foodie and love trying different cuisines. I listen to soft pop, and countryside music. In my free time, if I am not sleeping, I'm either scrolling Twitter or reading a novel!

Oh and my birthday is on September 2 and I love surprise gifts! xD 

Now that you know a bit about me I would love to know more about you. So drop me an email, and let's connect!
