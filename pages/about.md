# **About Me**

Hey, there! I am **{{ site.author.name }}** <br>

I am a graduate of BITS Pilani, currently working as a Software Engineer at Palo Alto Networks. During my time at BITS, I developed a deep interest in computer science and its applications, particularly in machine learning, cybersecurity, and systems programming. Both my research and industry experiences have played a key role in providing me with a solid foundation, helping me transform theoretical knowledge into practical solutions.

My research internships have allowed me to delve into advanced topics like machine learning model robustness and the security of AI systems. These experiences not only sharpened my technical proficiency but also deepened my understanding of the ethical implications of deploying machine learning and AI technologies in real-world scenarios. I strongly believe that the future of AI depends on building systems that are both innovative and responsible, ensuring that these technologies are used ethically and securely. My industry experience at organizations like Palo Alto Networks has given me hands-on exposure to real-world applications, such as optimizing firewall systems and enhancing security protocols, further solidifying my ability to apply these principles in practice.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have worked on a range of projects that allowed me to apply my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and emerging technologies. These opportunities have reinforced my passion for creating impactful solutions and deepened my commitment to the ethical use of technology.

Outside of academics and work, I enjoy staying active and exploring new hobbies. I love hiking, traveling, and discovering new cuisines—especially when shared with friends. I’m a huge foodie and always up for trying something new! I also enjoy reading novels, listening to music, and watching movies. If you’re interested in discussing tech, AI ethics, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out—I’d love to chat!
