- title: ML Software Engineer, CureSkin.ai
  from: Jul 2020
  to: Aug 2020
  description: <ul> <li>Built a pipeline capable of detecting six classes of wrinkles on human faces irrespective of their age, gender or face tone. </li>
                <li>Experimented with image processing techniques like Binarization, Gaussian Filter and Hessian Line Tracking in order to highlight them.</li>
                <li>Certain wrinkles (like those around the eyes) are more common than others. I selected the RetinaNet architecture to tackle the imbalanced dataset.</li>
                <li>The pipeline achieved a Mean Average Precision (maP) of 0.5. It was deployed on the <a href="https://cureskin.com/">CureSkin</a> application, with over a million downloads.</li></ul>

  description: <ul> <li>Developed a service for JioLiv, and devised an intelligent algorithm based on structural similarity index to filter out non-redundant movie frames.</li>
                <li>Implemented a Tensorflow-based text detection and recognition pipeline to read words off the movie frames.</li>
                <li>Subsequently, I formulated a logic using spaCy and TextRank to extract contextually significant phrases (single-worded or multi-worded) from the generated text.</li></ul>

  from: Apr 2020
  to: May 2020
  description: <ul> <li>Built a pipeline to detect price tags from images of supermarket shelves and interpret prices from them.</li>
              <li>To detect minuscule price tags, the Single Shot Object Detector based on Feature Pyramid Network was implemented.</li>
              <li>A YOLO-based Multi-Digit Classifier was trained to read digits off the price tags.</li>
              <li>The entire pipeline achieved a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.6, and is being deployed by Xplorazzi Technologies. <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/price-tag-detector-multi-digit-classification-using-tensorflow-object-detection-and-svhn-38506705bcf2">[View Details]</a> </li></ul>
