description: Managed a team of nearly 20 students in the design and manufacturing of our team’s first Formula Student Electric Vehicle, guiding the project from initial concept to final delivery. Coordinated efforts across multiple subsystems, ensuring smooth communication and alignment between design, engineering, and production teams. Oversaw task distribution, set timelines, and resolved technical challenges to keep the project on schedule while maintaining high-quality standards.

The vehicle was developed to compete in a prestigious national-level competition featuring top engineering teams from across India. Despite it being our first attempt at building an electric vehicle, our team’s dedication, problem-solving abilities, and innovative thinking resulted in a successful performance, securing us 2nd place in the event. This achievement not only showcased our technical capabilities but also reflected the strength of teamwork and effective leadership.
