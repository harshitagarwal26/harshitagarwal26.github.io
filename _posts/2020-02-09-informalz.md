description: Led a team of nearly 20 students in the design and manufacturing of our teamâ€™s first Formula Student Electric Vehicle, managing the project from concept to completion. I coordinated efforts across various subsystems, ensuring smooth communication between design, engineering, and production teams, while overseeing task allocation, timelines, and troubleshooting to maintain quality and meet deadlines. Developed for a national-level competition featuring top teams from across India, our vehicle showcased strong teamwork, problem-solving, and innovation, earning us 2nd place despite this being our first attempt at building an electric vehicle.
