description: I successfully led a team of nearly 30 students to plan and execute the concerts for our annual college festival, ensuring every event was a memorable experience. This role required meticulous organization, including inviting and coordinating with artists, managing schedules, arranging technical setups, and overseeing logistical planning. I worked closely with team members to delegate tasks effectively, resolve challenges promptly, and maintain clear communication throughout. By fostering collaboration and attention to detail, we delivered seamless and engaging events that were widely appreciated by attendees and participants alike.
